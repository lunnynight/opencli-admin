"""Integration tests for the websocket branch of FleetAuthMiddleware (ADR-0005).

Uses starlette.testclient.TestClient (sync, real websocket handshake) against
the actual app + real endpoints (/api/v1/nodes/ws, /api/v1/browsers/agents/ws)
rather than the httpx ASGITransport `client` fixture used elsewhere in this
suite, which cannot drive websockets at all.

TestClient(app) is instantiated WITHOUT a `with` block so the app's lifespan
does not run (no scheduler / control-cycle / DB-migration startup needed for
these handshake-only assertions). The websocket endpoints under test open
their own AsyncSessionLocal() sessions directly and swallow DB errors as
non-fatal (see backend/api/v1/nodes.py / browsers.py), so no DB fixture is
required either — a real (possibly empty/misconfigured) DB session may fail
those upserts, and the handshake still completes.

One exception: api/v1/browsers.py's agent_ws_endpoint() calls
backend.browser_pool.get_pool(), which raises (uncaught) if init_pool() was
never called — normally done by main.py's lifespan. Without it the handshake
would hang (the endpoint's except-block logs and returns without ever
answering ws.receive_json()). The `_browser_pool_initialized` autouse fixture
below calls init_pool([]) directly (synchronous, no DB/Redis) so browsers.py
tests don't depend on running the full lifespan.
