"""actuator: execute exactly three whitelisted control actions
(issue 03 / PR-Control-4).

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md, ADR-0004, ADR-0007. This module is
the ONLY code in the control layer allowed to mutate a ``DataSource`` or a
``CronSchedule`` on the control system's behalf — every other module in
``backend.control`` (evaluator, policies, ledger, outcomes, service) is
advisory-only by hard rule.

Whitelist (exactly three, ADR-0004): ``increase_interval``, ``pause``,
``require_review``. A suggested ``ControlAction.action_type`` outside this
whitelist (or one of the two aliases below) never executes as itself —
``execute_action`` downgrades it to ``require_review`` (the Require-Review
Downgrade) while preserving the ORIGINAL suggested action_type/payload in the
ledger row it writes, so an audit of what was suggested is never lost to the
downgrade.

Alias mapping (``backend.control.policies.suggest_actions`` predates this
module and already named its suggestions before the whitelist was fixed):
``pause_source`` and ``pause_low_priority`` -> ``pause``;
``require_auth_review`` -> ``require_review``. Both are semantically already
what the whitelist entry does, so they execute AS the whitelisted action
(not a downgrade) — see :func:`resolve_action_type`.
