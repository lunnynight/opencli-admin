"""ledger: persist suggested ControlActions as evidence (PR-Control-3.5).

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5. The feedback law
(``backend.control.policies``) is only trustworthy if we can measure how
often its suggestions turn out to be justified — this module writes each
surfaced suggestion to the ``control_actions`` table
(``backend.models.control_action.ControlActionRecord``) so the outcome pass
(``backend.control.outcomes``) can judge it against the source's subsequent
sensor readings.

HARD RULE: recording evidence is NOT acting. Nothing here mutates a
``DataSource``, calls the scheduler, or executes anything — every row is
written with ``executed=False``. PR-Control-4's actuator is intended to call
:func:`record_advisory_actions` too (with ``mode="automatic"``) so both
advisory and executed decisions share one auditable ledger.

Dedup: the control-state endpoint is polled by the frontend, so the same
unresolved state re-surfaces the same suggestions every few seconds. A
suggestion is skipped when the latest ledger row for the same
``(source_id, action_type)`` carries the same state and is younger than the
dedup window — re-observing an unchanged error signal adds no information,
while a state CHANGE (different verdict for the same action) is always worth
a fresh row.
