"""outcomes: judge recorded advisory suggestions against later evidence
(PR-Control-3.5).

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5. The ledger
(``backend.control.ledger``) records what the feedback law suggested; this
module closes the loop by re-reading the plant AFTER the decision and asking
one question per row: did the triggering state clear?

    * "recovered"          — re-classifying the source from its post-decision
      ``source_measurements`` rows no longer yields the state that triggered
      the suggestion. (Deliberately NOT "post state is healthy": an
      auth_failed source that is now merely degraded still recovered FROM
      auth_failed — each judgment is scoped to its own trigger.)
    * "persisted"          — the post-decision evidence still classifies to
      the same state; the problem outlived the suggestion window.
    * "insufficient_data"  — the source never produced another measurement
      within the stale window. An honest "we never got to see", not a verdict.

Re-classification reuses the EXACT live pipeline — ``aggregation.
row_to_measurement`` + ``aggregation.trend_from_rows`` + ``evaluator.
evaluate`` with the same resolved :class:`SourceObjective` the control-state
endpoint applies — the source's stored objective override (if any), merged
over defaults through ``backend.control.objectives.resolve_objective`` — so
a judgment can never disagree with the endpoint merely because it read the
sensor, or the setpoints, differently.

Advisory-only, like everything in PR-Control-3.x: this module writes ONLY the
judgment columns (evaluated_at / outcome / outcome_detail) back onto
``control_actions`` rows. It never touches a ``DataSource`` and never
executes anything. Deterministic given ``now``: tests inject it explicitly.
