"""service: the one measure -> evaluate -> record decision path (PR-Control-3,
PR-Control-3.5, prefactored ahead of PR-Control-4).

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md. The control-state endpoint
(``backend.api.v1.sources.get_source_control_state``) and the future Control
Cycle (issue 03) must never disagree about a source's state because one of
them read the sensors differently — the same principle already documented in
``backend.control.outcomes`` for outcome judgment. This module is that single
path: aggregate the source's latest sensor reading (preferring the persisted
``source_measurements`` table, falling back to the PR-Control-2 TaskRunEvent
path — see ``backend.control.aggregation``), compute a rolling trend, derive
a full ``SourceControlState`` (``backend.control.evaluator``), map that state
onto advisory ``ControlAction`` suggestions (``backend.control.policies``),
and persist a best-effort record to the Evidence Ledger
(``backend.control.ledger.record_advisory_actions``).

HARD RULE, unchanged from the endpoint's original docstring: this function is
ADVISORY ONLY. It never mutates the source's ``DataSource`` row and never
calls the scheduler. Ledger recording is best-effort — a ledger write failure
is logged and swallowed, never raised, so a caller that only wants a read
(e.g. a GET endpoint) can never be turned into a 500 by evidence bookkeeping.
Callers that need read-only decision data without writing evidence should
pass ``record_evidence=False`` (the Control Cycle records evidence itself
after this call, keyed off its own tick semantics, so it does not need this
function to do it twice).

system_context is NOT computed here — it is a source-independent snapshot of
shared ODP-plane state that callers already have their own idioms for
building (see ``backend.api.v1.sources._build_system_context``). Callers pass
it in as plain dict data (schema mirrors ``SystemContextRead``'s two fields
the evaluator consumes: ``odp_backpressured``, ``available``); this keeps the
function's imports free of API-layer collector wiring so it stays cleanly
callable from the future Control Cycle too.
