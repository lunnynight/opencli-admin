"""kill_switch: the global, in-memory runtime override for the Control
Cycle's execution gate (issue 03).

Two halves make up "the kill switch is off": ``Settings.control_kill_switch``
(config, resets on every restart) and this module's in-memory toggle (runtime
API, GET/POST ``/api/v1/control/kill-switch`` — see
``backend.api.v1.control``). Either one being "on" (True) short-circuits ALL
execution in ``run_control_cycle_once``, unconditionally, before any other
gate is evaluated.

Deliberately module-level state, not a DB row or Redis key: a single-operator
fleet (ADR-0005) does not need the toggle to survive a restart or to be
shared across processes — restarting the API is itself an acceptable way to
reset an accidentally-flipped switch back to the safe configured value.
