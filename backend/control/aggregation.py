"""Aggregate existing run evidence into a SourceMeasurement (read-only).

PR-Control-3: prefer the rich, truthful per-run rows C1's
``backend.control.recorder.record_run_measurement`` now persists to the
``source_measurements`` TABLE (``backend.models.source_measurement.
SourceMeasurement`` — accepted/duplicates/rejected/error_rate/duplicate_rate/
error_kinds/cursor_advanced/freshness_lag_seconds/source_ts_quality/...).
That table is the truthful sensor history; this module's job is to read its
latest row for a source and map it onto the pure
:class:`backend.control.measurements.SourceMeasurement` contract.

Falls back to the PR-Control-2 path (deriving a measurement from
TaskRun/TaskRunEvent evidence) only when the source has never had a
``source_measurements`` row recorded yet — e.g. a source that ran before C1
landed, or in a test that seeds TaskRun/TaskRunEvent directly without going
through the real pipeline/recorder. Every query here is a SELECT — this
module never writes, and it does not change collection/pipeline/runner
behavior.

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5. The measurement contract and the
safe rate derivation live in PR-Control-1
(:class:`backend.control.measurements.SourceMeasurement`) and are reused, not
redefined.

Where the TaskRunEvent-fallback numbers come from
--------------------------------------------------
A run's per-sink breakdown (accepted/duplicates/rejected) is NOT persisted to
its own columns anywhere on TaskRun — ``SinkResult`` flows transiently through
the pipeline and only its aggregate lands in the ``complete`` TaskRunEvent's
``detail`` JSON as ``{"collected", "stored", "skipped", "duration_ms"}`` (see
backend/pipeline/pipeline.py). So the ``complete`` event detail is the single
durable place a collected/stored/skipped breakdown survives in that fallback
path, and we map:

    accepted   := stored   (new records the sink committed)
    duplicates := skipped  (items recognized as already-seen)
    rejected   := max(0, collected - stored - skipped)

A failed run never emits a ``complete`` event; we still build a measurement
from ``TaskRun.records_collected`` (which the runner sets to ``stored``) rather
than returning ``None`` — a failed run is still evidence.
