"""record_run_measurement: persist one truthful SourceMeasurement row per run.

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md §0: "a controller cannot be built on a
sensor that lies." This module is the write side of that fix — it turns the
REAL outcome of one run (success or failure) into a
``backend.models.source_measurement.SourceMeasurement`` row, reusing
``backend.control.measurements.SourceMeasurement.derive()`` for the rate math
so the derivation logic lives in exactly one place.

Called from the pipeline AFTER a run's outcome is known (see
``backend/pipeline/pipeline.py``) — including failed runs: a failed run is
evidence too (empty accepted/duplicates, the terminal error_kind, whatever
latency was measured before the failure), not something to skip recording.
