"""Action executor — fixed verb set → SkillPage ops, ref-addressed (ADR-0003 D3).

This is the deterministic **act** primitive of the skill execute loop. It takes
*one* structured action the cheap model already chose (issue 03 picks it; issue
04 gates it) and performs it on a CDP-attached page, returning a uniform
structured result. It decides **nothing** about *which* action runs and never
classifies risk, opens a DB session, emits events, or builds a ``ChannelResult``
— those are issues 03/04/05.

Hard red line (ADR-0003 D2/D3): the verb set is exactly the fixed 7 below; any
other verb — explicitly including ``evaluate``/``js`` — is rejected with a
structured error, never executed. There is **no** model-facing JS escape hatch.

Module shape mirrors ``backend/skills/distill.py`` and
``backend/channels/opencli_channel.py``: a pure sync validator
(:func:`validate_action`) + pure ref resolver (:func:`resolve_ref`) tested
directly, and a single async dispatch (:func:`execute_action`) tested against a
mock ``SkillPage``. It imports nothing from ``backend.pipeline`` /
``backend.database`` / ``backend.models``; ``SkillPage`` is imported only under
``TYPE_CHECKING`` so the module loads with no browser / Playwright present.
