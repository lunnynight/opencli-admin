"""Fleet-LAN static bearer-token auth (ADR-0005, control-closeout issue 04).

The deployment surface is the operator's NetBird fleet LAN, so network
reachability must not equal operability: once a token is configured
(``API_AUTH_TOKEN`` / ``Settings.api_auth_token``), every HTTP request under
``/api`` must carry ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``.

Dev posture: with no token configured (the default) the API stays open, and
``enforce_bind_guard`` only allows that posture on a localhost bind. The
existing test suite therefore runs unchanged with no token configured.

Exemptions (deliberate — issue 04: "exempt if and only if they leak nothing"):

- ``GET /health`` — liveness only. docker-compose's healthcheck curls it with
  no credentials, so it must stay open; its body is slimmed to
  ``{"status": "ok"}`` (see backend/main.py) so it leaks nothing. The
  config-bearing detail (task_executor, ...) lives at the authenticated
  ``GET /api/v1/system/config`` instead.
- ``/docs``, ``/redoc``, ``/openapi.json`` — outside the ``/api`` prefix.
  They disclose the API *schema* but no data; issue 04's scope is "every
  /api route". Tighten separately if schema disclosure becomes a concern.

Websocket endpoints under ``/api`` (the agent reverse channel in
api/v1/nodes.py and api/v1/browsers.py) are guarded by this same middleware.
A connecting agent may present the token through either channel:

- ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` header — the primary path, set by
  agent_server.py's ``_auth_headers()`` when ``AGENT_API_TOKEN`` /
  ``API_AUTH_TOKEN`` is present in the agent's environment.
- ``?token=<token>`` query parameter — a fallback for clients that cannot
  set a WebSocket handshake header (browser ``WebSocket`` API, ``wscat``
  debugging, etc.).

A handshake that fails either check is rejected *before* ``ws.accept()`` is
ever reached: the middleware sends a raw ``websocket.close`` ASGI event with
code ``4401`` (the conventional "auth failure" websocket close code, chosen
to mirror HTTP 401) and never calls the wrapped app, so no endpoint code
runs against an unauthenticated socket.

Migration path (rollout is two independent, order-tolerant steps):

1. Deploy the updated agent_server.py to fleet nodes first. With no
   ``AGENT_API_TOKEN``/``API_AUTH_TOKEN`` set in the agent's environment,
   ``_auth_headers()`` returns ``{}`` and the connect call is byte-for-byte
   what it was before — a no-op rollout.
2. Once ready, set ``API_AUTH_TOKEN`` on the center. Any agent that hasn't
   picked up the env var yet gets its handshake closed with 4401 instead of
   accepted. That is not a crash: ``_register_via_ws``'s reconnect loop
   catches the close, backs off, and retries indefinitely (see
   agent_server.py). The fleet self-heals the moment an operator sets
   ``AGENT_API_TOKEN`` on that node's environment and restarts/redeploys it
   — no center-side action required beyond having set the token.

The MCP server (backend/mcp_server.py) and CLI (backend/cli.py) are HTTP
*clients* of this API running as separate processes; they read
``API_AUTH_TOKEN`` from their own environment and attach the same header.
