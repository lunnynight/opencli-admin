"""Outbound-fetch SSRF guard.

Deployment context (see AUDIT item B3): this system runs on a LAN reachable
over a NetBird/WireGuard mesh, not exposed via public port-mapping — so
*inbound* auth is handled by the WG layer and is out of scope here. SSRF is an
*outbound* threat instead: a channel/notifier/processor fetches a URL that
came from a user or from DB-stored config (or, worse, from content a remote
server chose to return, e.g. a redirect Location), and the server itself ends
up reaching an internal fleet peer (100.80.x.x), a localhost service (redis,
postgres), or exfiltrating an LLM provider API key to an attacker-controlled
public host. WireGuard does not protect outbound traffic, which is exactly
why this module exists.

``validate_public_url`` is the single choke point every outbound-fetch call
site in this codebase should call before opening a connection to a
user/DB-supplied URL. It:

  * requires ``http``/``https`` scheme (rejects ``file://``, ``gopher://``,
    ``ftp://``, etc — these can hit local files or talk to unintended
    protocols on internal-only ports),
  * resolves the hostname and rejects the URL if *any* resolved address is
    loopback, private (RFC1918 / ULA), link-local (including the cloud
    metadata address ``169.254.169.254``), unspecified, multicast, or
    otherwise not "globally reachable",
  * rejects a raw-IP host in those same ranges without needing DNS at all.

Callers that also need the resolved IP (to pin a redirect-safe connection,
see the DNS-rebinding note below) can use :func:`validate_public_url_and_ip`.

DNS-rebinding closure — ``guarded_async_client`` / ``PinnedAsyncHTTPTransport``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module used to resolve and validate the hostname *once*, at call time,
without pinning the actual TCP connection to the IP that was validated — a
window in which a sufficiently motivated attacker who controls DNS for the
target hostname could rebind the name to a private IP *between* our check and
httpx's own connect() a moment later (TOCTOU).

That gap is now closed for plain-httpx call sites via
:func:`guarded_async_client`, which returns an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` whose
transport is a :class:`PinnedAsyncHTTPTransport`. The mechanism:

  * :class:`PinnedAsyncHTTPTransport` subclasses ``httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport``
    (so it inherits its TLS/proxy/limits setup unchanged) and swaps in its own
    ``httpcore.AsyncConnectionPool`` built with a ``network_backend`` that
    wraps :class:`_PinnedNetworkBackend`.
  * ``_PinnedNetworkBackend.connect_tcp(host, port, ...)`` is the *only* hook
    that changes: when ``host`` matches the guarded hostname, it dials one of
    the validated IPs instead of letting the OS resolver run again — this is
    exactly the seam httpcore exposes for a custom resolver
    (``httpcore.AsyncConnectionPool(network_backend=...)``).
  * Crucially, TLS SNI and certificate verification are **not** affected: per
    ``httpcore``'s own ``AsyncHTTPConnection._connect``, ``server_hostname``
    for ``start_tls`` defaults to the connection's ``Origin.host`` — i.e. the
    *original hostname from the URL* — completely independent of what
    ``network_backend.connect_tcp`` actually dialed. So the socket connects to
    the pinned IP while the ``Host`` header, SNI, and cert verification all
    still use the real hostname: HTTPS keeps working exactly as if no pinning
    were in place.
  * Defense in depth: ``_PinnedNetworkBackend.connect_tcp`` re-runs
    :func:`is_ip_blocked` on the IP it is about to dial (not just the IPs
    validated a moment earlier), so even a compromised/rebound resolver
    swapped in after validation can't smuggle a blocked address through.

:func:`guarded_async_client` is the one-stop call for callers that just want
"validate this URL and get me a client safe to fetch it with" — it validates
the URL, builds the pinned client, and returns ``(client, validated_url)``.
Callers that need a transport instead of a full client (rare) can use
:class:`PinnedAsyncHTTPTransport` directly.

Residual scope — SDK-only sites: a few call sites (LLM SDKs — ``openai``'s
``AsyncOpenAI``, ``crawl4ai``'s ``LLMConfig``) don't take an httpx transport
in a way this module can cleanly intercept in every case, or go through a
vendor SDK's own connection handling. Those sites keep call-time
``validate_public_url``/``avalidate_public_url`` validation only (the
pre-existing mitigation) and retain a residual DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window —
documented at each such call site rather than silently left unmentioned.
