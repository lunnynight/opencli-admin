"""Plan Health: record + read shared-segment node health (issue 04, ADR-0009
Two-Tier Attribution).

Writing is owned by ``backend.plan_ir.executor`` (one row per shared node per
run). This module is the read side plus the one write helper, kept together
so both the executor and the HTTP router go through the same narrow surface
— mirrors ``backend/services/control_ledger_service.py``'s "list" precedent,
plus a single ``record_node_health`` write helper alongside it (Plan Health
has no separate recorder module the way ``backend.control.recorder`` is
split out, because — unlike per-source measurements — nothing outside the
executor ever writes a Plan Health row).
