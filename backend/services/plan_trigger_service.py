"""Dataflow triggering (issue 05, ADR-0009, docs/plan-ir-issues/05): the
glue between "a source's own collection just delivered new data" and "every
runnable Plan containing that source runs its downstream shared segment
incrementally."

Schedules stay attached to sources (zero migration, PRD Implementation
Decisions) — this module adds no cron of its own. It is called from exactly
one place, ``backend.pipeline.runner.run_collection_pipeline``'s Phase 4
(after a run's outcome is already durably finalized), so both scheduled and
manually-triggered collection go through the identical trigger path (both
``LocalExecutor`` and the Celery ``run_collection``/``run_scheduled_
collection`` tasks call ``run_collection_pipeline`` — see that module's
docstring precedent).
