    ``forward_to_odp`` gates a forward to the Rust ODP ingest hot path (fires
    only when ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` is ALSO set). Defaults to False: the ODP
    forward is opt-in, chosen explicitly by the write-seam layer under a
    source's ``write_strategy`` (``OdpSink`` / ``DualSink``, see
    ``backend/pipeline/sinks/strategy.py``), not an implicit side effect of a
    bare env var being present (P1-1). Previously this defaulted to True, so
    setting ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` anywhere forwarded every ``legacy``-strategy
    source's data into ODP too — bypassing the write_strategy state machine
    entirely and silently enrolling sources that were never migrated.
    ``LegacyDbSink`` (the ``legacy`` strategy's sink) now passes this
    explicitly; nothing should rely on the old implicit-True default.

    Returns (new_records, skipped_count).
