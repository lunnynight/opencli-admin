"""run_channel — the thick channel runner (Phase 1).

The runner owns every cross-cutting concern so a channel implements only the
source-specific ``fetch()``: it loads the cursor, builds a rate-limited + retrying
HTTP client, drives pagination via ``has_more`` / ``next_cursor``, and persists
the cursor after each page (so a crash mid-pagination resumes, not restarts).

This is the mechanism behind the north star: adding a real source is ~100 lines of
fetch + parse, because token refresh, rate limiting, retry/backoff, pagination,
and cursor state all live here, written once, reused by every channel.

Every collector.collect() call is now routed through here (not just incremental
channels): a channel that hasn't migrated fetch() gets the default adapter that
bridges to collect(), so it degrades to one page / no cursor / no rate limiting —
identical to calling collect() directly. Channels migrate by overriding fetch()
and reading ctx.cursor / ctx.http / ctx.auth / ctx.source_id.
