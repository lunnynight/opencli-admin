"""run_channel — the thick channel runner (Phase 1).

The runner owns every cross-cutting concern so a channel implements only the
source-specific ``fetch()``: it loads the cursor, builds a rate-limited + retrying
HTTP client, drives pagination via ``has_more`` / ``next_cursor``, and persists
the cursor after each page (so a crash mid-pagination resumes, not restarts).

This is the mechanism behind the north star: adding a real source is ~100 lines of
fetch + parse, because token refresh, rate limiting, retry/backoff, pagination,
and cursor state all live here, written once, reused by every channel.

Phase 1 status: additive and NOT yet wired into the collect stage of the live
pipeline (``backend/pipeline/collector.py`` still calls ``channel.collect``). It
runs against an in-memory cursor store and accepts an injected client/channel for
tests. The DB-backed cursor store, the migration, the RSS etag override, and the
switch of the collect stage from ``collect()`` to ``run_channel()`` are the next
slice.
