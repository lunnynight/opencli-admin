"""LegacyDbSink — the original write path, now behind the ItemSink seam.

Normalizes items (``content_hash`` dedup) and stores them in
``collected_records``, exactly as the pipeline did inline before the seam
existed. Extracting it changes no behavior: it still calls
``normalizer.normalize_items`` then ``storer.store_records`` inside a
short-lived session.

Two things stay where they were on purpose, to keep this slice behavior-only:
  * The ODP forward still lives inside ``storer.store_records`` (fires only
    when ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` is set AND ``forward_to_odp`` is True), now behind
    a ``forward_to_odp`` gate so DualSink can suppress it on the legacy leg.
    The dedicated ``OdpSink`` owns the forward going forward; ``write_strategy``
    (``backend/pipeline/sinks/strategy.py``) picks the destination explicitly.
  * Dedup here remains ``content_hash`` (title|url|content|source_id). The ODP
    path keys on ``(source_id, event_id)`` instead; the two will disagree, and
    surfacing that disagreement under shadow is the point of the migration.

    ``forward_to_odp`` gates the ODP shadow-forward that lives inside

    (this sink's default construction in ``select_sink``) must NOT forward to
    ODP just because a bare ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` env var happens to be set
    elsewhere in the deployment — that was the P1-1 strangler-collapse bug
    (an unmigrated source silently leaking into ODP, bypassing the
    write_strategy state machine entirely). Only a sink built for an explicit
    ODP-aware strategy (``odp_shadow`` / ``odp_dual_required`` / ``odp_primary``,
    via ``DualSink``) opts a source into the forward now, and DualSink already
    constructs its legacy leg with ``forward_to_odp=False`` regardless (so
    ``OdpSink`` is the single sender, avoiding a double-send).
