"""Skill channel — execute a distilled SKILL.md against a real page.

The closed-loop **execute** leg of the skill subsystem (ADR-0003): read a
distilled SKILL.md card, bind a real browser from the shared pool (same CDP
substrate the opencli channel uses), and let a *cheap* text model drive the page
step by step until it emits ``done`` or hits the step cap.

This file is the **spine seam** (issue 05): it stays inside the existing
``task → run → pipeline → events → record`` flow without changing
``AbstractChannel.collect``'s signature. The perceive→gate→act loop itself lives
in :mod:`backend.skills.loop` (issue 03); the risk-tiered confirm gate lives in
:mod:`backend.skills.risk` (issue 04); this channel only *drives* them:

  * read ``run_id`` / ``chrome_endpoint`` out of ``parameters`` (the pipeline
    injects them — :func:`backend.pipeline.pipeline.run_pipeline` mirrors its
    ``opencli`` special-case),
  * acquire a CDP endpoint from :mod:`backend.browser_pool` and attach a
    Playwright page (issue 01's :class:`backend.skills.page.SkillPage`),
  * resolve the cheap-executor ``provider`` and bind a ``model_call`` to it
    (reusing the agent dock's OpenAI tool-calling shape),
  * run the loop (:func:`backend.skills.loop.run_skill_loop`), emit one
    ``TaskRunEvent`` per step via ``events.emit(run_id, ...)``,
  * return ``extract`` records as :class:`ChannelResult` items and propagate
    ``awaiting_confirm`` in ``ChannelResult.metadata`` (the loop sets it when the
    gate blocks a write in headless v1).

Issue 06 adds the **feedback** leg on top of this seam: after the loop, the
channel assembles a ``journey_trace_v1`` from the loop's own step records +
outcome (:func:`backend.skills.trace.assemble_trace`), computes a
:func:`~backend.skills.trace.self_eval` against the skill's
``terminal_conditions`` / ``milestones``, appends that self-eval to
``skills.evidence`` (when a persisted :class:`~backend.models.skill.Skill` row is
resolvable), and surfaces the trace on ``ChannelResult.metadata['trace']`` (the
``correct`` leg / re-distill lives in :mod:`backend.skills.correction`).

``skill_id`` / ``(domain, capability)`` → DB resolution for *loading* the
SKILL.md is wired in :func:`_resolve_skill` (a short-lived ``AsyncSessionLocal``,
same pattern as the self-eval write — ``collect()`` holds no injected session).
Still deferred (v2): cross-process pause/resume of an ``awaiting_confirm`` run.
