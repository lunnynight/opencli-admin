"""Plan IR (Intermediate Representation) — the versioned JSON schema for
Plan graphs (ADR-0008/0009, docs/plan-ir-PRD.md, issue 01).

A Plan is a free graph: any number of source / transform / merge / sink
nodes wired together by port-referenced edges. This module defines the
Pydantic shape of that graph — the same models back both the documented
JSON schema exposed at ``GET /api/v1/plan-ir/schema`` (the API contract
agents author Plans through, story 27) and the structural validator in
``backend.plan_ir.validation``.

Scope note (issue 01): this module defines the IR shape and its schema
only. Persistence (a ``plans`` table, issue 02) and execution (issues
03/04) are explicitly out of scope here — nothing in this module or its
router writes to a database.
