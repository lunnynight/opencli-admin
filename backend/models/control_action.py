"""ControlActionRecord (DB row): the advisory evidence ledger (PR-Control-3.5).

See docs/CONTROL_THEORY_ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5. PR-Control-3's feedback law
(``backend.control.policies``) suggests ControlActions but nothing records
whether those suggestions were RIGHT. This table closes the observation half
of that loop: every advisory suggestion the control-state endpoint surfaces
lands here as one row, and ``backend.control.outcomes`` later judges it
against the source's subsequent ``source_measurements`` rows — did the
triggering state clear on its own ("recovered"), stay broken ("persisted"),
or did the source simply never run again ("insufficient_data")?

This is EVIDENCE, not execution: writing a row here never touches the
``DataSource``, the scheduler, or any channel behavior. The ``mode`` and
``executed`` columns exist so a future PR-Control-4 actuator can reuse the
same ledger for actions it actually performs — in this PR ``mode`` is always
"advisory" and ``executed`` is always False.

Naming note: ``backend.control.models.ControlAction`` is the pure Pydantic
suggestion contract (in-memory, one decision); this ORM row is that
suggestion PLUS its decision context (state/mode/measurement snapshot) and
its eventual outcome judgment — a superset, hence the distinct name.
