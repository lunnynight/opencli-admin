    """One shared-segment node's health for one Plan run (issue 04, ADR-0009
    Two-Tier Attribution).

    Plan Health is the shared-segment's OWN observability dimension — it is
    to a shared node (merge/transform/sink) what ``SourceMeasurement`` is to a
    source segment, and the two are deliberately never the same table: a
    dedupe node raising must never touch ``source_measurements`` or any
    ``DataSource`` control-state column (that is the hard attribution
    contract this table exists to make checkable — a shared-segment failure
    is visible ONLY here and in this table's own rows).

    One row per (plan, node, run): ``run_key`` groups every node's row for a
    single ``run_plan_once`` pass (not a DB foreign key — a Plan run touches
    no other Plan-run table row) so a caller can fetch "this run's health"
    without needing a separate PlanRun table (issue 04 scope: node-level
    health rows are all that's required; whole-run bookkeeping already lives
    on ``PlanRunResult``, returned directly by the executor and the HTTP
    response body, never persisted).
